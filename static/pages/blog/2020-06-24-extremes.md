Hello,

This is my test blog. I am very scared of writing it and expressing myself in general but I am going to do it anyway. :) This post is about how I can never have emotions that are not extreme. Extreme annoyance is my most common mood. :) I dont know why but I am trying to figure myself out through this blog.
