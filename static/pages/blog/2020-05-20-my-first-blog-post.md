Hello, welcome to my blog! 

Six elements - A short animation that shows 6 elements morphing into one another. A face i admire - An expression I despise - An object I wish I had - A space I want to be in/ experience - A texture I like - A space/element/object Iâ€™d like to be.

You can find it on my vimeo: [here](https://vimeo.com/327434482).

Or watch it below in an inframe.
